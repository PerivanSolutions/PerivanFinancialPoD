<h4>
  Fast turnaround printing
</h4>
<p>
  We are geared to produce fast turnaround documents, working with you to meet
  your timetable for delivery. Even when your plan goes wayward - perhaps
  struggling to get all parties to sign off or last minute changes  - our
  response is to come up with a solution to still deliver those important
  documents on time.
</p>
<h4>
  Just-in-time printing
</h4>
<p>
  Most offices have boxes of printed documents sitting somewhere collecting
  dust. Invariably this is because someone has ordered too many copies
  'just-in-case'. Things are changing at a fast pace, so last month's message
  is already out of date.
</p>
<p>
  This is an unnecessary waste of time, money, paper and space. That's why we
  encourage ordering 'just-enough'. If you run out and need more, it's simple,
  we can always print you a few more and refresh your information at the same
  time.
</p>
<p>
  It's just virtual storage as opposed to static and physical.
</p>
<h4>
  Variable data
</h4>
<p>
  Everyone likes to see their name in print, and it is simple to do. You can
  also be much more effective in your messaging and targeting, without sending
  generic information to the masses.
</p>
<p>
  This way, you print less, spend less and get better results.
